This project is an extensive set of bindings around Lucene++  
(http://github.com/ustramooner/LucenePlusPlus/). This project
contains generic swig .i files which are used by all languages.

At this stage, there is currently only one language implementation,
but the intention is that more language bindings can easily be 
created.

Instructions on checking out clucene-bindings with git:

 git clone git://github.com/ustramooner/clucene-bindings.git
  
 cd clucene-bindings
  
 git submodule update --init

Please see documentation, issues, etc in each subproject:
