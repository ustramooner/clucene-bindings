This project is an extensive set of bindings around Lucene++  
(http://github.com/ustramooner/LucenePlusPlus/). This project
contains generic swig .i files which are used by all languages.

There is currently only one language implementation, and is 
contained in git submodules by the name of the language. Please
read the README.rst in a submodule of interest.

Instructions on checking out clucene-bindings with git:

 git clone git://github.com/ustramooner/clucene-bindings.git
  
 cd clucene-bindings
  
 git submodule update --init
